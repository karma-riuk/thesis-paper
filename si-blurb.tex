\section{The Software Institute}

The Software Institute (SI) is part of the Faculty of Informatics of the Universit\`a della Svizzera italiana (USI), located in beautiful Lugano, in Southern Switzerland.

At the SI, our strength is discovering, designing, and developing new ideas that ease the conception of modern software systems. Our research is rooted both in sound theoretical models as well as practical, real-life questions that impact modern society, a society where reliable, well engineered software systems have become quintessential.

The SI is a center of excellence committed to the teaching, the research and the development of software. The SI was founded and is currently directed by Michele Lanza and features renowned software researchers among its members: Profs. Gabriele Bavota (Software Analytics \& Empirical Software Engineering), Matthias Hauswirth (Software Performance), Cesare Pautasso (Software Architecture \& Web Engineering), Carlo Alberto Furia (Software Engineering, Formal Methods \& Verification), and Paolo Tonella (Software Testing).

The SI offers a new and unique Master program in Software \& Data Engineering.
